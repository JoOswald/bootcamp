Compulsory Task 2 - some Capstone project files from HyperionDev DfE bootcamp
#Capstone Project VII Unsupervised Machine Learning
This notebook contains the final project in the Unsupervised Machine Learning module of the Data Science bootcamp course run by HyperionDev
and funded by the Department for Education.
The notebook uses the UsArrests.csv data about arrests per 100,000 population in 50 US states in 1973 for Rape, Assault and Murder.  The 
dataset also contains the percentage of Urban Population for each state.
As part of the task the following was performed
* The data was analysed for shape and content, formats tidied and null values were identified (there weren't any)
* A correlation heatmap was produced to look for correlation between features in the dataset
* The data was scaled using a standard scalar
* Principal Component Analysis was performed and the variance of each component analysed to determine how many components to include
* A new dataframe was compiled from the two principal components and this was analysed with reference to the original data to produce 
a biplot
* An Agglomerative Clustering technique was applied to the data, the best linkage established and a scatterplot produced
* Finally a K-means Clustering technique was applied to the same data producing very similar results
